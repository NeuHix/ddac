To crossmatch two catalogues we need to compare the angular distance between objects on the celestial sphere.

People loosely call this a "distance",  
but technically it's an angular distance: the projected angle between objects as seen from Earth.

If we have an object on the celestial sphere with right ascension and declination $\left(\alpha_1, \delta_1\right)$ ,  
then the angular distance to another object with coordinates $\left(\alpha_2, \delta_2\right)$ is:

$$
d=2 \arcsin \sqrt{\sin ^2 \frac{\left|\delta_1-\delta_2\right|}{2}+\cos \delta_1 \cos \delta_2 \sin ^2 \frac{\left|\alpha_1-\alpha_2\right|}{2}}
$$
