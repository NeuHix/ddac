_In the last set of activities you learned about basic Python data manipulation
and a common astronomy data format: FITS files.
You used this to calculate the mean stack of a set of astronomy images._


_Now we're going to look at a different statistical measure — the median,
which in many cases is considered to be a better measure than the mean
due to its robustness to outliers._

_However, a naïve implementation of the median algorithm can be very inefficient
when dealing with large datasets. 
Luckily, computer scientists have spent a lot of time thinking
about this problem and have found some good solutions._
