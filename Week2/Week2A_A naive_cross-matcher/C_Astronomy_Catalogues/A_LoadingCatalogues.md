Before we can crossmatch our two catalogues we first have to import the raw data. Every astronomy catalogue tends to have its own unique format so we'll need to look at how to do this with each one individually.

We'll look at the AT20G bright source sample survey first. The raw data we'll be using is the file `table2.dat` from [this page](http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?J/MNRAS/384/775) in the VizieR archives, but we'll use the filename `bss.dat` from now on.

Every catalogue in VizieR has a detailed README file that gives you the exact format of each table in the catalogue.
