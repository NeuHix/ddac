The positions of stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects are usually recorded in either **Equatorial** or **Galactic** coordinates.

Equatorial coordinates are fixed relative to the celestial sphere, so the positions are independent of when or where the observations took place. They are defined relative to the celestial equator (which is in the same plane as the Earth's equator) and the ecliptic (the path the sun traces throughout the year).

A point on the celestial sphere is given by two coordinates:

- **Right ascension** -> the angle from the _vernal equinox_ to the point, going east along the celestial equator;
- **Declination** -> the angle from the _celestial equator_ to the point, going north (negative values indicate going south).

The vernal equinox is the intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic where the ecliptic rises above the celestial equator going further east.

The coordinates of stars in the sky will change slightly over the years due to the slow wobble of Earth's axis. Therefore, _it is important to specify the epoch or time period which we are using as a reference for the **celestial coordinate system**._
